INTRODUCTION 
The shop where most of the work is performed on different machines is called machine shop. In machine shop, the raw material is cut, machined, formed or shaped with the help of macproduced

Different machines used in machine shop are: 
1. Lathe machine 
2. Shaper 
3. Milling machine 
4. Planning machine 
5. Drilling machine 
6. Grinding machine 
7. Threading machine.

 LATHE MACHINE
A lathe is a powered mechanical device in which the work is held and rotated against a suitable cutting tool for producing cylindrical forms in the metal, wood or any other machinable material.

Principle of working 
The principle of lathe machine is that it holds the work between two strong supports called as centres, or in a chuck or face plate which revolves. The chuck or the centre is mounted on the main spindle of the machine. The cutting tool is rigidly supported in a tool post and it is fed against the rotating job. The job rotates in its axis and the tool is moved either parallel or to an inclination with its axis as such a cylindrical or tapered surface is produced.

Types of Lathe:
There are various types of lathe. They are as 
(a) Precision lathe
(b) Tool room lathe 
(c) Capstan and turret lathe 
(d) Automatic lathe 
(e) Engine lathe 
(f) Speed lathe 
(g) Bench lathe
(h) Special purpose lathe  

SPECIFICATIONS OF LATHE MACHINE
The size of the lathe is specified by one of the following ways:
A. Length of the Bed (Bed length will include headstock).
B. Distance between centres (Max. job length that can be held between centres). 
C. Diameter of the work which can be turned between the ways. (max. dia. that can be rotated). 
D. Height of centres
E. Swing over carriage. 

 OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON LATHE MACHINE 
The following Operations can be performed on a lathe machine. 
1. Facing 
2. Rough Turning 
3. Shouldering 
4. Radius Turning 
5. Necking 
6. Taper Turning 
7. Thread Cutting 
8. Forming 
9. Chamfering
10. Knurling 
11. Drilling 
12. Boring 
13.Counter Sinking 
14.Counter Boring


MILLING MACHINE 
A machine tools which is used for producing flat or profiled surfaces, grooves or slots with the help of revolving multiple tooth cutter is known as milling machine. Milling machine occupies a place opposite to lathe. 

Principle of working
Circular cutter revolves beneath which job is given feed in a straight line, to form chip thickness. Stress on cutting point of the milling cutter is not heavy as that in the lathe. For rest of the revolution it runs idle and can cool off. it cuts only for a part of revolution. 

Size and Specification 
Milling machine size is defined by the dimension of its table i.e., (Length and Breadth). Other main specification of this machine Is horse power of the motor, speed of the spindle, Feed and the drive. 

TYPES OF MILLING MACHINES Milling machines are being made of numerous sizes and types.
They are classified as under: 

1. Column and Knee Type Milling: Work table is supported on knee like casting which can slide in vertical direction along vertical column. The table can travel longitudinally and cross-wise. It can be moved up and down. It is of three types: 
(a) Horizontal Milling Machine 
(b) Vertical Milling Machine 
(c) Universal Milling Machine

2. Planar Milling Machine: This is high production machine jobs. It is similar to double housing planar. In the planar tool post spindle carries are mounted which are operated by individual motors. In addition two horizontal milling heads are fitted on a cross rail. 
The other two types are: 
(a) Fixed Bed milling machine 
(b) Special types of milling machines.

Milling Operations
1. Slots and Steps
2. Centre cutting and mill key way
3. Boil and mill halt round slot
4. Side cutting mill key way
5. Convex cutter half round slot
6. Face mill or shell mill
7. End mill phases
8. Shell mill
9. Packet milling
10. Cutting deep slot.


SHAPER
Shaper is a versatile machine which is primarily intended for producing flat surfaces. These surfaces may be horizontal, vertical or inclined. This machine involves the use of single point toot held in a properly designed tool box mounted on a reciprocating ram.

Working Principle 
In shaper the job is rigidly held in a machine vice. Tool is held in the tool post mounted on the ram. This ram reciprocates to and fro and so the cutting of the material takes place in the toward stroke of ram and return stroke is ideal. The job is given index feed normal to the line of action of cutting tool.

SPECIFICATION OF SHAPER 
Shaper is Specified by following parameters: 
(a) Maximum length of stroke 
(b) Table top (length x width) 
(c) Table horizontal travel 
(d) Table vertical travel 
(e) Tool box-vertical travel 
(f) No. and range of speed obtained 
(g) No. and range of feeds
(h) Swivel base, vise, width and depth of jaw 
(i) Swivel base 
(j) Size of tool 
(k) Horse power of power 
(l) Speed ol motor. 

SHAPER OPERATIONS
(a) Horizontal Flat Surface Machining
(b) Vertical Surface Machining
(c) Machining Angular Surface
(d) Cutting Slots and Keyways
(e) Irregular Surface
(f) Machining Splines or Cutting Gears.
