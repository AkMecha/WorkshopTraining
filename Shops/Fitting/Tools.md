1. <dt>**Vernier Calliper**:</dt>
<dd>Vernier Calliper is a precision instrument used for measuring lengths and diameters. It can be used for measuring external and internal dimensions. It consists of a graduated bar of rectangular section. It has two jaws, one is movable with a small vernier head and the other is fixed. A fine adjustment nut is also attached to the head. The dimension is measured by the jaws and is indicated on graduated bar. Minimum dimension that can be expressed on vernier calliper is known as least count. The least count of vernier is 0.001' or 0.02mm. Generally, the material of all parts is stainless steel.</dd>

1. <dt>**Vernier Height Gauge**:</dt>
<dd>It Is used to measure the height of work pieces. It consists of a vertical bar mounted on a heavy base. A sliding head with pointer is carried on to the rectangular bar. The bar and head are graduated. Height gauge is also used for marking the lines at specific heights. It is always used by placing it on surface plate. The base of the height gauge is made up of cast iron and the beam is made up of stainless steel.</dd>

1. <dt>**Micrometer**:</dt>
<dd>It is used for measuring diameters or thickness of any job. It is more precise than vernier calliper. It consists of a hook type frame. A hard anvil is screwed on one end. On the second end a spindle moves to and fro carrying another small anvil on its end. By turning the spindle knob the job diameter is measured from the scale. The sleeve on the spindle is graduated. Another barrel which is fitted on outer side of the sleeve is attached with the spindle. This barrel is also graduated. A ratchet is provided on the side of the spindle. The graduation on micrometer is available in inches as well as in millimetres. The least count of the micrometer is generally .001‚Äù or .0001" or .01mm or .05mm.</dd>

1. <dt>**Combination Set**:</dt>
<dd>It is a multi-purpose instrument that can be used as a protractor, a level, a mitre, a centre square and a try square.</dd>

1. <dt>**Feeler Gauge**:</dt>
<dd>It is used to check the gap between two mating parts. It consists of a number of metal leaves. These leaves have different thickness and are fastened together in a small holder. The material of the leaves is stainless steel.</dd>
