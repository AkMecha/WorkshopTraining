INTRODUCTION 

Fitting work is a very important work in engneering. ln fitting shop unwanted material is removed with the help of hand tools. it is done for mating, repair and manufacturing purposes. The person working in fitting shop is called fitter. A fitter should have the complete knowldge ot the tools used in the shop. Commonly used tools are hacksaw, files, chiesels etc.

Tools:

i) Vernier Calliper: Vernier Calliper is a precision instrument used for measuring lengths and diameters. it can be used for measuring external and internal dimensions. it consists of a graduated bar of rectangular section. It has two jaws, one is movable with a small vernier head and the other is fixed. A fine adjustment nut is also attached to the head. The dimension is measured by the jaws and is indicated on graduated bar. Minimum dimension that can be expressed on vernier calliper is known as least count. The least count of vernier is 0.001' or 0.02 mm. Generally, the material of the all parts is stainless steel.

ii) Vernier Height Gauge: It Is used to measure the height of work pieces. it consists of a vertical bar mounted on a heavy base. A sliding head with pointer is carried on to the rectangular bar. The bar and head are graduated. Height gauge is also used as marking the lines at specific heights. It is always used by placing it on surface plate. The base of the height gauge is made up of cast iron and the beam is made up of stainless steel. 

iii) Micrometer: it is used for measuring diameters or thickness of any job. it is more precision than vernier calliper. it consists of a hook type frame. A hard anvil is screwed on one end. On the second end a spindle moves to and for carrying another small anvil on its end. By turning the spindle knob the job diameter is measured from the scale. The sleeve on the spindle is graduated. Another barrel which is fitted on outer side of the sleeve is attached with the spindle. This barrel is also graduated. A ratchet is provided on the side of the spindle. 
The graduation on micrometers are available in inches as well as in millimetres. The least count of the micrometer is generally .001‚Äù or .0001" or .01 mm or .05mm. 

iv) Combination Set: It is a multi-purpose instrument that can be used as a protector, a level, a mitre, a centre square and a try square.

v) Feeler Gauge: lt is used to check the gap between two mating parts. It consists of a number of metal leaves. These leaves have different thickness and are fastened together in a small holder. The material of the leaves is stainless steel.
